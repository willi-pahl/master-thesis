{"result_0":" This function takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two different elements in the list that sum to zero, otherwise it returns False. The function uses a set to keep track of numbers seen so far and checks if the current number's complement (opposite) has been seen before. If it has, it means that there is a pair of numbers that add up to zero and it returns True. It also handles the edge case where there are less than two elements in the list. Here is the code:\n\n```php\nfunction pairsSumToZero($l){\n    $seen = []; // Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen numbers\n    foreach ($l as $num) {  // Iterate through each number in the list\n        if (isset($seen[-$num])) {  // Check if complement has been seen before\n            return true;  // If it has, then there is a pair that adds up to zero\n        }\n        $seen[$num] = true;  // Add current number to set for future checks\n    }\n    return false;  // No pairs found, so return False\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses a set to keep track of numbers seen so far and checks if the current number's complement (opposite) has been seen before.

{"result_1":" This function takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two different elements in the list that sum to zero, otherwise it returns False. The function uses a set to keep track of numbers seen so far and checks each number against the set for its negative value. If found, it means there is a pair that sums to zero. It also handles edge cases like an empty or single-element list. Here's how it would look:\n\n```php\nfunction pairsSumToZero($l) {\n  if (count($l) < 2) return false; // Edge case for empty or single-element list\n\n  $seen = [];\n\n  foreach ($l as $num) {\n    if (in_array(-$num, $seen)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    $seen[] = $num;\n  }\n\n  return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses a set to keep track of numbers seen so far and checks each number against the set for its negative value.

{"result_2":" This function takes a list of integers as input and returns True if there are two different elements in the list that sum to zero, otherwise it returns False. The function uses nested loops to iterate through each element in the list and compares it with every other element in the list. If it finds two elements that add up to zero, it returns True. If no such pair is found, it returns False.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n```php\nfunction pairsSumToZero($l) {\n    $n = count($l);\n    for ($i = 0; $i < $n - 1; $i++) {\n        for ($j = $i + 1; $j < $n; $j++) {\n            if ($l[$i] + $l[$j] == 0) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\nThis function uses nested loops to iterate through each element in the list and compares it with every other element in the list.

{"result_3":" In this code, we iterate through the list and store each element's absolute value as a key in the hash map. If an element's absolute value is already present in the hash map, it means that there are two elements with opposite signs that add up to zero. We return true if such a pair exists. Otherwise, we return false.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input list contains at least two elements. If you want to handle the case where the list has less than two elements, you can add an additional check for the length of the list before iterating through it."}
