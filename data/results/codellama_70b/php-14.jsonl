{"result_1":" This is a simple problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. We can use the concept of memoization to store the results of previous calculations and reuse them in future calculations, which will improve the efficiency of our solution. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Create an array `memo` to store previously calculated values. Initialize all elements to `-1`.\n2. Define a function `fib4($n)` that takes an integer as input and returns its corresponding Fib4 value.\n3. Check if the value of `memo[$n]` is already calculated (i.e., not equal to `-1`). If it's already calculated, return the stored value. This step helps us avoid redundant calculations and improves efficiency.\n4. Otherwise, calculate the value using the formula: `fib4($n) = fib4($n-1) + fib4($n-2) + fib4($n-3) + fib4($n-4)`.\n5. Store the calculated value in the `memo` array for future use.\n6. Return the calculated value.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of this approach:\n\n```php\nfunction fib4($n){\n    static $memo = [0, 0, 2]; // Initialize memo with first three values (fib4(0), fib4(1), and fib4(2))\n    \n    if ($n < 3) {\n        return $memo[$n]; // Return the corresponding value for n=0, 1, or 2\n    }\n    \n    if ($memo[$n] != -1) { // Check if the value is already calculated (i.e., not equal to -1)\n        return $memo[$n]; // If it's already calculated, return the stored value\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate and store the value for fib4(n) using the formula: fib4($n) = fib4($n-1) + fib4($n-2) + fib4($n-3) + fib4($n-4)\n    $memo[$n] = fib4($n - 1) + fib4($n - 2) + fib4($n - 3) + fib4($n - 4);\n    \n    return $memo[$n]; // Return the calculated value\n}\n```\n\nThis solution uses memoization to store previously calculated values in an array `memo`. This way, we can avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency. The function `fib4` takes a single integer as input and returns its corresponding Fib4 value."}

{"result_3":" This is a simple implementation of the Fib4 sequence using dynamic programming. It uses an array to store previously calculated values, which helps in reducing redundant calculations and improves performance.

It first checks for invalid input (negative numbers) and then handles base cases (0, 1, and 2). If the input is valid, it initializes an array with the base cases of the Fib4 sequence (`[0, 0, 2]`), then iterates from index 3 to `n` using a for loop. In each iteration, it calculates the next element in the sequence by adding the previous three elements (using the previously calculated values stored in the array). Finally, it returns the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses dynamic programming to store and reuse previously calculated values, reducing redundant calculations and improving performance."}
