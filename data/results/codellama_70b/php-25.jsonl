{"result_0":" This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial with coefficients in $xs. The result is an array containing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n\nThe function uses the power rule to calculate the derivatives of each term. For example, if we have a term like `3x^2`, its derivative would be `6x`.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```php\nfunction derivative($xs) {\n  $result = [];\n\n  // Iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n  for ($i = 1; $i < count($xs); $i++) {\n    // Calculate the coefficient of the derivative term.\n    $coefficient = $xs[$i] * $i;\n\n    // Add it to the result array.\n    $result[] = $coefficient;\n  }\n\n  return $result;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each term, it calculates the coefficient of its derivative by multiplying the original coefficient with the power of the variable. Then, it adds this new coefficient to the result array.\n\nThe resulting array contains the coefficients of the derivative polynomial."}
{"result_1":" This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial with coefficients stored in an array. The result is returned as an array containing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n\nThe function takes one argument, which is the array of coefficients for the original polynomial. It iterates through each coefficient and calculates its derivative by multiplying it by the power of x (starting from 1) and adding it to a new array. The final result is returned as an array containing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction derivative($xs){\n    $result = []; // Create an empty array to store the coefficients of the derivative polynomial\n    for ($i=1; $i<count($xs); $i++){  // Iterate through each coefficient starting from the second one (index 1)\n        $coefficient = $xs[$i] * $i;  // Calculate the derivative by multiplying the coefficient with its power of x (starting from 1)\n        array_push($result, $coefficient);  // Add the new coefficient to the result array\n    }\n    return $result;  // Return the array containing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial\n}\n```\n\nNow you can call this function with an array of coefficients and it will calculate the derivative and return the resulting coefficients as an array."}
{"result_2":" This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial. It takes an array of coefficients as input and returns an array of coefficients for the derivative of the polynomial. The first element in the input array represents the constant term, while each successive element represents the coefficient of x^n where n is the index of the element.\n\nThe function starts by initializing a new array to store the coefficients of the derivative. It then iterates through the input array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element in the input array, it calculates the coefficient for the corresponding term in the derivative and adds it to the output array. The coefficient for the derivative is calculated by multiplying the original coefficient by the exponent of the term (which is equal to the index of the element + 1).\n\nHere's an example:\n```php\n$xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5];\nderivative($xs); // Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]\n```\nIn this case, the polynomial is represented as 3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4. The derivative of this polynomial is 1 + 2x^1 + 6x^2 + 12x^3 + 20x^4.\n\nHere's the code:\n```php\nfunction derivative($xs) {\n    $derivative = [];\n    for ($i = 1; $i < count($xs); $i++) {\n        $coefficient = $xs[$i] * ($i + 1);\n        array_push($derivative, $coefficient);\n    }\n    return $derivative;\n}\n```\nThis function takes an array of coefficients as input and returns the derivative in the form of an array. It iterates through the input array starting from the second element (index 1) and calculates the coefficient for each term in the derivative by multiplying the original coefficient with the exponent of the term (which is equal to the index + 1). The calculated coefficients are added to a new array, which is returned as the result.\n\nThis function assumes that the input array contains at least one element. If you need to handle cases where the input array is empty or has only one element, you can add additional checks and adjust the code accordingly."}
{"result_3":" This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial with coefficients in $xs. The function returns an array containing the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.\n\nThe function uses the power rule to calculate the derivatives for each term. For example, if we have a term like 3x^2, its derivative is 6x.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```php\nfunction derivative($xs) {\n    $result = [];\n    // Loop through all coefficients except the first one (constant term)\n    for ($i = 1; $i < count($xs); $i++) {\n        // Calculate the coefficient of the derivative using power rule\n        $coefficient = $xs[$i] * $i;\n        array_push($result, $coefficient);\n    }\n    return $result;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all coefficients except the first one (constant term) and calculates the coefficient of the derivative using power rule.

{"result_4":" This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial. The input is an array representing the coefficients of the polynomial. The output is an array representing the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.\n\nThe code for this function is as follows:\n```php\nfunction derivative($xs) {\n    $result = [];\n    if (count($xs) > 0) {\n        $result[] = 1; // The coefficient of x^0 is always 1.\n    }\n    for ($i = 1; $i < count($xs); ++$i) {\n        $coefficient = $xs[$i] * $i;\n        if ($coefficient != 0) {\n            $result[] = $coefficient;\n        }\n    }\n    return $result;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the array of coefficients, starting from the second element (index 1). For each coefficient, it multiplies it by its power and adds it to the result. The first coefficient is always 1 because the derivative of a constant term is 0."}
