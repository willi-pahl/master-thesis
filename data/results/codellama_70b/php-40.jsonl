{"result_0":" This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of digits of the largest prime number in the list. If there is no prime number, it should return 0. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```php\nfunction skjkasdkd($lst) {\n    $max_prime = 0; // Initialize a variable to store the maximum prime value\n\n    foreach ($lst as $number) {\n        if (isPrime($number)) { // Check if the number is prime\n            $max_prime = max($max_prime, $number); // Update the maximum prime value if necessary\n        }\n    }\n\n    return digitSum($max_prime); // Return the sum of digits of the largest prime number or 0 if there are none\n}\n\n// Function to check if a number is prime\nfunction isPrime($n) {\n    if ($n <= 1) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    for ($i = 2; $i * $i <= $n; $i++) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the sum of digits of a number\nfunction digitSum($number) {\n    $sum = 0;\n\n    while ($number > 0) {\n        $sum += $number % 10; // Add the last digit\n        $number = (int)($number / 10); // Remove the last digit\n    }\n\n    return $sum;\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we iterate through each number in the list and check if it's a prime number using the `isPrime` function. If it is, we update the `$max_prime` variable with the maximum prime value found so far. After iterating through all numbers, we use the `digitSum` function to calculate the sum of digits of the largest prime number or return 0 if there are no prime numbers in the list.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input list contains only positive integers. If negative integers can be present, you may need to modify the code accordingly."}
