{"result_1":" This is a simple problem that can be solved by counting the number of odd and even numbers in both lists. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, then it's possible to exchange elements between them to make all elements of lst1 even. Here's an implementation:\n\n```php\nfunction exchange($lst1, $lst2) {\n  // Count the number of odd and even numbers in both lists\n  $odd_count = count(array_filter($lst1, function ($x) { return $x % 2 == 1; }));\n  $even_count = count(array_filter($lst2, function ($x) { return $x % 2 == 0; }));\n\n  // If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, then it's possible to exchange elements between them to make all elements of lst1 even.\n  if($odd_count == $even_count) {\n    return \"YES\";\n  } else {\n    return \"NO\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we use the `array_filter` function to count the number of odd and even numbers in both lists. We then compare these counts to determine whether it's possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all elements of lst1 even. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, we return \"YES\". Otherwise, we return \"NO\".\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes that both lists contain only integers (no floating-point values). If you need to handle floats or other types of data, you'll need to modify the code accordingly."}
{"result_2":" This function takes two lists of numbers as input and determines if it is possible to swap elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers. It returns \"YES\" if it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all elements in lst1 even, or \"NO\" if it is not possible.\n\nHere's an example:\n```php\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n* The input lists will not be empty.\n* There is no limit on the number of elements that can be exchanged between lst1 and lst2.\n\nHere's a possible implementation in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction exchange($lst1, $lst2) {\n  // Count the number of odd numbers in lst1\n  $odd_count = count(array_filter($lst1, function ($x) { return $x % 2 == 1; }));\n  \n  // If there are more odd numbers than elements in lst2, it's not possible to exchange\n  if ($odd_count > count($lst2)) {\n    return \"NO\";\n  }\n  \n  // Sort the lists in ascending order\n  sort($lst1);\n  sort($lst2);\n  \n  $i = 0;\n  while ($i < count($lst1) && $odd_count > 0) {\n    if ($lst1[$i] % 2 == 1) {\n      // Swap the odd number with the largest element in lst2\n      $temp = $lst1[$i];\n      $lst1[$i] = array_pop($lst2);\n      array_push($lst2, $temp);\n      \n      $odd_count--;\n    }\n    \n    // Increment the index for lst1\n    $i++;\n  }\n  \n  return \"YES\";\n}\n```\n\nThis function first counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1`. If there are more odd numbers than elements in `lst2`, it's not possible to exchange. Otherwise, it sorts both lists in ascending order and iterates through `lst1` until all odd numbers have been swapped with the largest element in `lst2`. It returns \"YES\" if all odd numbers were exchanged successfully."}
{"result_3":" This function takes two lists of numbers and determines whether it is possible to exchange elements between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers. It returns \"YES\" if it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all elements of lst1 even, or \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nHere's an example:\n```php\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \"YES\"\nexchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \"NO\"\n```\n\nAssuming the input lists will not be empty.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n```php\nfunction exchange($lst1, $lst2) {\n    // Count the number of odd numbers in lst1\n    $odd_count = 0;\n    foreach ($lst1 as $num) {\n        if ($num % 2 != 0) {\n            $odd_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if there are enough even numbers in lst2 to make all elements of lst1 even\n    $even_count = 0;\n    foreach ($lst2 as $num) {\n        if ($num % 2 == 0) {\n            $even_count++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If there are enough even numbers in lst2 to make all elements of lst1 even, return \"YES\"\n    if ($odd_count <= $even_count) {\n        return \"YES\";\n    } else {\n        return \"NO\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the elements of `lst1` and counts the number of odd numbers. Then it iterates through the elements of `lst2` and counts the number of even numbers. If there are enough even numbers in `lst2` to make all elements of `lst1` even, it returns \"YES\". Otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input lists will not be empty. If you need to handle empty lists, you can add a check for an empty list at the beginning of the function and return \"NO\" if either list is empty."}
{"result_4":" This is a simple problem that can be solved with some basic logic and programming skills. Here's a possible solution in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Function to check if it's possible to exchange elements between two lists to make the first list even numbers only\nfunction exchange($lst1, $lst2) {\n    // Initialize variables for counting odd and even numbers in each list\n    $odd_count1 = 0;\n    $even_count1 = 0;\n    $odd_count2 = 0;\n    $even_count2 = 0;\n    \n    // Count the number of odd and even numbers in lst1\n    foreach ($lst1 as $num) {\n        if ($num % 2 == 0) {\n            $even_count1++;\n        } else {\n            $odd_count1++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Count the number of odd and even numbers in lst2\n    foreach ($lst2 as $num) {\n        if ($num % 2 == 0) {\n            $even_count2++;\n        } else {\n            $odd_count2++;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Check if it's possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even\n    if ($even_count1 + $odd_count2 >= count($lst1)) {\n        return \"YES\";\n    } else {\n        return \"NO\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Test cases\n$result = exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]); // YES\necho $result . \"\n\";\n\n$result = exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]); // NO\necho $result;\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n\n*   We use two nested loops to count the number of odd and even numbers in each list.\n*   Then we check if it's possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even. This is done by comparing the total number of even numbers in lst1 (including those from lst2) with the size of lst1. If the former is greater than or equal to the latter, then we can exchange elements to achieve our goal.\n*   Finally, we return \"YES\" if it's possible and \"NO\" otherwise."}
