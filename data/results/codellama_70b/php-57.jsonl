Was die meisten Menschen jedoch nicht wissen, ist die Tribonacci-Folge. Die Tribonacci-Folge wird durch die Rekursion definiert: tri(1) = 3 tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, wenn n gerade ist. tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), wenn n ungerade ist. Zum Beispiel: tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2 tri(4) = 3 tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 Sie erhalten eine nicht-negative ganze Zahl n und mÃ¼ssen eine Liste der ersten n + 1 Zahlen der Tribonacci-Folge zurÃ¼ckgeben.

{"result_4":" This is a recursive function that calculates the Tribonacci sequence up to the nth term. The Tribonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n* If n is even, then T(n) = (n / 2) + 1\n* If n is odd, then T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n+1)\n\nHere's a PHP function that calculates the Tribonacci sequence up to the nth term:\n\n```php\nfunction tri($n){\n  if ($n < 0) {\n    return false; // negative numbers are not allowed\n  } elseif ($n == 1) {\n    return [3]; // base case for T(1) = 3\n  } elseif ($n % 2 == 0) {\n    return array_merge([], tri($n-1), [(int)(($n / 2) + 1)]); // even n\n  } else {\n    $t1 = tri($n-1); // odd n, calculate T(n-1)\n    $t2 = tri($n-2); // odd n, calculate T(n-2)\n    $t3 = tri($n+1); // odd n, calculate T(n+1)\n    return array_merge([], $t1, [$t2[count($t2)-1] + $t3[0]]); // add the last element of T(n-2) and first element of T(n+1)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses recursion to calculate the Tribonacci sequence.
