{"result_0":" This function will return true if the input string contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets. It will also handle cases where there are multiple pairs of square brackets, and it will not return true for strings that contain only one pair of square brackets.\n\nHere is an example solution:\n\n```php\nfunction isNested($string) {\n    $openBrackets = 0;\n    $closedBrackets = 0;\n\n    // Iterate through the string and count the number of open and closed brackets\n    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($string); $i++) {\n        if ($string[$i] == '[') {\n            $openBrackets++;\n        } elseif ($string[$i] == ']') {\n            $closedBrackets++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If there are no open brackets, return false\n    if ($openBrackets == 0) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check for validity of the sequence by comparing the number of open and closed brackets\n    if (($closedBrackets >= $openBrackets) && ($openBrackets > 1)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each character in the string, counting the number of open and closed brackets. If there are no open brackets, it returns false. Otherwise, it checks if the number of closed brackets is greater than or equal to the number of open brackets, and that the number of open brackets is greater than 1 (indicating a nested sequence). If both conditions are met, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.\n\nThis function assumes that the input string contains only square brackets and no other characters. If you need to handle additional characters in the string, you can add more logic to ignore non-bracket characters or return false if there are any invalid characters."}
{"result_1":" This function should return true if the string contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets, and false otherwise. The function should handle strings that contain only square brackets (no other characters). You can assume that the input string will always be non-empty.\n\nHere's an example solution in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction isNested($string) {\n    $openBrackets = 0;\n    for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($string); $i++) {\n        if ($string[$i] == '[') {\n            $openBrackets++;\n        } elseif ($string[$i] == ']' && $openBrackets > 1) {\n            return true;\n        } elseif ($string[$i] == ']') {\n            $openBrackets--;\n        }\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the string character by character, keeping track of the number of open brackets. If it finds a closing bracket and there is more than one open bracket at that point, it knows that there must be a nested pair of brackets. It returns true in this case. Otherwise, if it reaches the end of the string without finding any nested pairs, it returns false.\n\nPlease note that this solution assumes that the input string only contains square brackets and no other characters. If you need to handle strings with other characters, you would need to modify the function accordingly."}
{"result_2":" This function should return true if the given string contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets. It should return false otherwise.\n\nThe function takes in a string as input, which only contains square brackets (no other characters). The function should check if there is at least one pair of nested square brackets within the string.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n* `is_nested('[[]]')` returns true because it contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets.\n* `is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]')` returns false because there is no valid sequence of nested square brackets in this string.\n* `is_nested('[][]')` returns false because the square brackets are not nested.\n* `is_nested('[]')` returns false because there are no square brackets within another pair of square brackets.\n* `is_nested('[[]][[]]')` returns true because it contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets.\n* `is_nested('[[]][[')` returns true because it contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets.\n\nCan you complete the function to check if there is at least one pair of nested square brackets within the string?"}
{"result_3":" This function takes a string as input and returns true if the string contains at least one nested pair of square brackets. It returns false otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets, and checks whether there is at least one closing bracket for each opening bracket. If there are more closing brackets than opening ones, it means that there is a nested pair of brackets.\n\n```php\nfunction isNested($string) {\n    $stack = [];\n    foreach (str_split($string) as $char) {\n        if ($char === '[') {\n            array_push($stack, $char);\n        } elseif ($char === ']' && count($stack)) {\n            array_pop($stack);\n        }\n    }\n    return count($stack) > 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses the `str_split` function to split the string into an array of characters. It then iterates through each character and checks if it is a `[`. If so, it pushes it onto the stack. If it's a `]`, it pops from the stack only if there are still opening brackets on the stack.\n\nAfter going through all the characters in the string, the function checks whether there are any remaining open brackets on the stack. If there are, then that means there is at least one nested pair of square brackets, and it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false."}
{"result_4":" This function checks if the given string contains a valid sequence of nested square brackets. It returns true if at least one pair of square brackets is nested within another pair, and false otherwise.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The function first counts the number of opening brackets `[` and closing brackets `]` in the string. If the count doesn't match, we can immediately return false because there are unbalanced brackets.\n2. Next, we iterate through each character in the string, keeping track of the current nesting level (initialized to 0). We increment the nesting level whenever we encounter an opening bracket `[` and decrement it when we find a closing bracket `]`.\n3. If at any point during this iteration, the nesting level becomes negative (i.e., there are more closing brackets than opening brackets), we can return false because that means we've encountered a closing bracket without an opening one to match it.\n4. Finally, if we find a valid pair of nested brackets, we set a flag `nested` to true and break out of the loop. If this flag remains false after iterating through the entire string, then there are no valid pairs of nested brackets, so we return false.\n5. Otherwise, if at least one pair of nested brackets is found, we return true.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```php\nfunction isNested($string) {\n  $openBrackets = substr_count($string, '[');\n  $closeBrackets = substr_count($string, ']');\n\n  if ($openBrackets != $closeBrackets) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  $nestingLevel = 0;\n  $nested = false;\n\n  for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($string); $i++) {\n    if ($string[$i] == '[') {\n      $nestingLevel++;\n    } else if ($string[$i] == ']' && $nestingLevel > 1) {\n      $nested = true;\n      break;\n    } else if ($string[$i] == ']') {\n      $nestingLevel--;\n    }\n  }\n\n  return $nested;\n}\n```\n\nThis function should work for all valid inputs.
