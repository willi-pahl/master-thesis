{"result_0":" In this example, the function takes a list of numbers and applies a linear transformation to scale them between 0 and 1. The smallest number becomes 0, and the largest number becomes 1. The other numbers are scaled proportionally. Here is how you can implement it in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction rescaleToUnit($numbers) {\n    $min = min($numbers);\n    $max = max($numbers);\n\n    if ($min == $max) {\n        return array_fill(0, count($numbers), 1.0); // All numbers are equal, so set all to 1.0\n    }\n\n    $scaledNumbers = [];\n\n    foreach ($numbers as $number) {\n        $scaledNumber = ($number - $min) / ($max - $min);\n        array_push($scaledNumbers, $scaledNumber);\n    }\n\n    return $scaledNumbers;\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then calculates the scaled value for each number by subtracting the minimum from the current number, dividing it by the difference between the maximum and minimum, and adding that result to the array of scaled numbers. The function returns an array containing the scaled numbers."}
{"result_1":" In this code, the function `rescale_to_unit` takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with all values scaled to fit within the range [0.0, 1.0]. The scaling is performed by subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This ensures that the smallest value becomes 0.0 and the largest value becomes 1.0.\n\n```php\nfunction rescale_to_unit($numbers) {\n    $min = min($numbers);\n    $max = max($numbers);\n    $range = $max - $min;\n    return array_map(function ($x) use ($min, $range) {\n        return ($x - $min) / $range;\n    }, $numbers);\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses the `array_map` function to apply a callback function to each element of the input array. The callback function calculates and returns the scaled value for each number by subtracting the minimum value from it and then dividing by the range (maximum - minimum)."}
{"result_2":" In this example, the smallest number in the list is 1 and the largest is 5. Therefore, we need to scale the numbers so that 1 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 1. We can achieve this by subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing each result by the range (maximum - minimum).\n\nHere's a possible implementation in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction rescaleToUnit($numbers) {\n    $min = min($numbers);\n    $max = max($numbers);\n    $range = $max - $min;\n\n    return array_map(function ($x) use ($min, $range) {\n        return ($x - $min) / $range;\n    }, $numbers);\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we first find the minimum and maximum values in the list. Then, for each number in the list, we subtract the minimum value from it to get the distance from the smallest value. We then divide this result by the range (maximum - minimum) to scale the numbers between 0 and 1.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the input array contains at least two elements. If you want to handle arrays with a single element, you can add an additional check for the length of the array before performing the scaling operation."}
{"result_3":" The function can be implemented as follows:\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction rescale_to_unit(array $numbers) {\n    if (count($numbers) < 2) {\n        throw new Exception('The list must contain at least two elements.');\n    }\n\n    // Find the minimum and maximum values in the array\n    $min = min($numbers);\n    $max = max($numbers);\n\n    // If the range is zero, return an array with all zeros\n    if ($max == $min) {\n        return array_fill(0, count($numbers), 0.0);\n    }\n\n    // Calculate the scaling factor to transform the values to [0,1]\n    $scale = 1 / ($max - $min);\n\n    // Apply the linear transformation and return the result\n    return array_map(function($x) use ($min, $scale) {\n        return ($x - $min) * $scale;\n    }, $numbers);\n}\n```\nThis function takes an array of numbers as input. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array to determine the range. If the range is zero (i.e., all elements are equal), it returns an array with all zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a scaling factor to transform the values into the range [0,1]. Finally, it applies the linear transformation to each element of the input array and returns the transformed result.\n\nPlease note that this function assumes that the input array contains at least two elements. If you want to handle cases where the input array has fewer than two elements, you can add additional checks or modify the function accordingly."}
{"result_4":" In this example, the function `rescale_to_unit` takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with the same length where each number is scaled to fit within the range [0.0, 1.0]. The scaling is done by subtracting the minimum value from all elements and then dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This ensures that the smallest element becomes 0.0 and the largest becomes 1.0.\n\nHere's an example implementation in PHP:\n```php\nfunction rescaleToUnit($numbers) {\n    $min = min($numbers);\n    $max = max($numbers);\n    $range = $max - $min;\n\n    return array_map(function ($x) use ($min, $range) {\n        return ($x - $min) / $range;\n    }, $numbers);\n}\n```\nThis function uses the built-in `array_map` function to apply a callback function to each element of the input array. The callback function subtracts the minimum value from each number and then divides by the range (difference between maximum and minimum values). This ensures that all numbers are scaled within the range [0, 1].\n\nHere's an example usage:\n```php\n$numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];\n$scaledNumbers = rescaleToUnit($numbers);\nprint_r($scaledNumbers); // Output: Array ( [0] => 0 [1] => 0.25 [2] => 0.5 [3] => 0.75 [4] => 1 )\n```\nNote that this function assumes the input array has at least two elements, and it will not handle edge cases like an empty or single-element array gracefully. You can add additional checks to handle these cases if needed."}
