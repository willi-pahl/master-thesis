{"result_0":" This function takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the list. If there are no such numbers, it returns 0. Here is how you can implement this function:\n\n```php\nfunction doubleTheDifference($lst) {\n    $sum = 0;\n    foreach ($lst as $num) {\n        if (is_int($num) && $num > 0 && $num % 2 != 0) {\n            $sum += pow($num, 2);\n        }\n    }\n    return $sum;\n}\n```\n\nIn this function:\n\n*   We iterate through each element of the list using a `foreach` loop.\n*   For each number in the list, we check if it's an integer (`is_int($num)`), positive (`$num > 0`), and odd (`$num % 2 != 0`). If all these conditions are met, we add its square to the sum variable `$sum`.\n*   Finally, we return the value of `$sum`, which contains the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the list. If there are no such numbers, it returns 0."}
{"result_1":" This function takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of squares of only odd positive integers in the list. Negative numbers and non-integers are ignored. If the input list is empty, it returns 0. Here's how it works:\n\n```php\nfunction doubleTheDifference($lst) {\n    $sum = 0;\n    foreach ($lst as $number) {\n        if (is_int($number) && $number > 0 && $number % 2 != 0) {\n            $sum += pow($number, 2);\n        }\n    }\n    return $sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the list and checks each number for three conditions:\n\n1.  It must be an integer (`is_int()`).\n2.  It must be positive (`$number > 0`).\n3.  It must be odd (`$number % 2 != 0`).\n\nIf all these conditions are met, the function adds the square of that number to the sum using `pow()`. If any condition is not met, it skips that number and moves on to the next one in the list.\n\nFinally, after iterating through the entire list, it returns the total sum."}
{"result_2":" This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the list. If there are no such numbers, it returns 0. Here is how you can implement this function in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction doubleTheDifference($lst) {\n    $sum = 0;\n    foreach ($lst as $num) {\n        if (is_int($num) && $num > 0 && $num % 2 != 0) {\n            $sum += pow($num, 2);\n        }\n    }\n    return $sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each number in the list and checks if it is an integer, positive, and odd. If all these conditions are met, it adds the square of that number to a running total sum. The function returns this sum at the end."}
{"result_3":" This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the list. If the list is empty, it returns 0. Here's how it works:\n\n```php\nfunction doubleTheDifference($lst) {\n    $sum = 0;\n    foreach ($lst as $number) {\n        if (is_int($number) && $number > 0 && $number % 2 != 0) {\n            $sum += pow($number, 2);\n        }\n    }\n    return $sum;\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses a foreach loop to iterate through each number in the list. For each number, it checks if it is an integer and positive using the `is_int()` function. If it is also odd (not divisible by 2), it adds its square to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the input list contains only integers or floats. If you want to handle strings or other data types as well, you may need to add additional checks."}
