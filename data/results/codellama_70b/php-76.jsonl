{"result_1":" This function checks if the given three sides form a right triangle. It returns true if it is a right triangle and false otherwise. The function uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if any two sides can form a right angle with the third side. If the sum of squares of two sides equals the square of the remaining side, then it is a right triangle.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```php\nfunction rightAngleTriangle($a, $b, $c) {\n  // Sort the three sides in ascending order\n  $side1 = min($a, $b, $c);\n  $side2 = ($a + $b + $c - max($a, $b, $c)) / 2;\n  $side3 = max($a, $b, $c);\n  \n  // Check if the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied for any two sides\n  return (pow($side1, 2) + pow($side2, 2) == pow($side3, 2)) ? true : false;\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we first sort the three sides in ascending order to make it easier to check for a right angle. Then, we use the Pythagorean theorem to check if any two sides can form a right triangle with the third side. If the sum of squares of two sides equals the square of the remaining side, then it is a right triangle.\n\nThis function returns true if it is a right triangle and false otherwise."}

{"result_3":" This is a simple problem that can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem. Here's how you can solve it:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction rightAngleTriangle($a, $b, $c) {\n    // Check if any two sides are equal to each other\n    if (($a == $b && $a != $c) || ($b == $c && $b != $a) || ($c == $a && $c != $b)) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Check if the longest side is equal to the sum of the other two sides\n    if (max($a, $b, $c) ** 2 == pow(min($a, $b), 2) + pow(min($a, $c), 2)) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n*   We use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the longest side is equal to the sum of the other two sides. If it is, then we know that the triangle has a right angle.\n*   To find the longest side, we use the `max` function to get the largest value among the three inputs.\n*   We also use the `pow` and `min` functions to calculate the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\nThis solution works for all valid triangles, including isosceles right triangles where two sides are equal."}
{"result_4":" In PHP, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if a triangle is a right-angled triangle. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Sort the sides in ascending order (i.e., smallest side first). This ensures that the longest side is always on the opposite side of the 90Â° angle.\n2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the hypotenuse (`c`) and compare it with the remaining side (`b`). If they are equal, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle.\n3. Return `true` if the condition holds true; otherwise, return `false`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this logic in PHP:\n\n```php\nfunction rightAngleTriangle($a, $b, $c) {\n    // Sort sides in ascending order (smallest to largest).\n    $sides = [$a, $b, $c];\n    sort($sides);\n\n    // Calculate hypotenuse using Pythagorean theorem.\n    $hypotenuse = sqrt(pow($sides[1], 2) + pow($sides[0], 2));\n\n    // Check if the longest side is equal to the hypotenuse.\n    return ($sides[2] == $hypotenuse);\n}\n```\n\nThis function will return `true` if a right-angled triangle is formed, and `false` otherwise."}
