{"result_4":" In PHP, the `md5` function is used to calculate the MD5 hash of a string. The function returns an empty string if the input is an empty string.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```php\nfunction stringToMd5($text) {\n    // Check if text is an empty string\n    if (strlen($text) == 0) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate MD5 hash of the input string\n    $hash = md5($text);\n\n    return $hash;\n}\n```\n\nThis function takes a string as an argument, checks if it's empty and returns null if so. If not, it calculates the MD5 hash using the `md5` function and returns it. "}
