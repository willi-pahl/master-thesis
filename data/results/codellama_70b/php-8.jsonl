The callback function checks if each number is greater than zero and returns true only for positive numbers. The result of this operation is an array containing only positive numbers.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n*   We define a function `get_positive` that takes an array as input parameter `$numbers`.\n*   Inside the function, we use `array_filter` to filter out negative numbers from the given list.\n*   The callback function checks if each number is greater than zero and returns true only for positive numbers.\n*   The result of this operation is an array containing only positive numbers.\n\nThis code should meet your requirements.

{"result_2":" In this code challenge, you need to return only positive numbers from the given list.
