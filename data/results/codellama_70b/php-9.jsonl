{"result_0":" This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise. The function uses the trial division method to check for primality. Trial division is one of the most efficient algorithms for testing the primality of a number, with complexity O(âˆšn).\n\nfunction isPrime($n) {\n    // Check if n is a multiple of 2\n    if ($n % 2 == 0 && $n > 2) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Iterate from 3 to square root of n\n    for ($i = 3; $i <= sqrt($n); $i += 2) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nThis function first checks if the number is even and greater than 2. If it is, then it returns false as an even number cannot be prime. Then, it iterates from 3 to the square root of n with a step size of 2 (to skip even numbers). For each iteration, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, then n is not prime and the function returns false. If no such i exists, then n must be prime and the function returns true.\n\nNote that this function assumes that n is a positive integer greater than 1. If you want to handle negative numbers or 0, you should add additional checks at the beginning of the function."}
{"result_1":" This function checks if a number is prime or not. It returns true if the number is prime, and false otherwise. The function uses a simple algorithm to check for divisibility by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number. If it finds a factor, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.\n\nHere's an optimized version of the code:\n\n```php\nfunction isPrime($n) {\n    if ($n <= 1) return false;\n    else if ($n == 2 || $n == 3) return true;\n    else if ($n % 2 == 0 || $n % 3 == 0) return false;\n\n    for ($i = 5; $i * $i <= $n; $i += 6) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0 || $n % ($i + 2) == 0) return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThis code is more efficient because it skips even numbers and multiples of 3. It also checks only up to the square root of the number, which reduces the time complexity significantly."}
{"result_2":" This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise. The function uses the trial division method to check for primality. Trial division is an efficient algorithm for testing the primality of small integers. It consists of dividing n by each integer between 2 and sqrt(n). If we find a factor in this range, then n is composite. Otherwise, it is prime.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```php\nfunction isPrime($n) {\n    if ($n <= 1) return false; // numbers smaller than or equal to 1 are not prime\n    if ($n <= 3) return true; // small primes\n    if ($n % 2 == 0 || $n % 3 == 0) return false; // divisible by 2 or 3\n\n    for($i = 5; $i * $i <= $n; $i += 6) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0 || $n % ($i + 2) == 0) return false;\n    }\n\n    return true; // n is prime!\n}\n```\n\nIn this function, we first check for the special cases of numbers smaller than or equal to 1. These are not prime numbers. Then, we check if the number is less than or equal to 3. If it is, then it's a prime number. Next, we check if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If so, it's not a prime number.\n\nAfter that, we use a loop to check for factors of n from 5 up to sqrt(n). We divide n by each number and also by the next one (i + 2) in the sequence. If any of these divisions has a remainder of zero, then n is not prime. Otherwise, it's a prime number.\n\nThis function uses the trial division method to check for primality. It's efficient for small numbers, but it becomes slower as the size of the input increases."}
{"result_3":" This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise. The function uses the trial division method to check for primality. Trial division is an efficient algorithm for testing the primality of a number, but it can be slow for very large numbers.\n\nfunction isPrime($n) {\n    // Check if n is a multiple of 2\n    if ($n % 2 == 0 && $n > 2) {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // Iterate from 3 to square root of n\n    for ($i = 3; $i <= sqrt($n); $i += 2) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nThis function is efficient and can be used to check for primality of numbers up to a few million. If you need to check for larger numbers, consider using more advanced algorithms like the Miller-Rabin test or AKS algorithm."}
{"result_4":" This function checks if a given number is prime or not. It returns true if the number is prime and false otherwise.\n\nThe code uses a simple algorithm to check for primality.
