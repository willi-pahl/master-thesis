We initialize a `$balance` variable to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account.\n2. We iterate over each operation in the input array using `foreach`.\n3. For each operation, we add it to the current balance using `$balance += $operation`. This updates the balance based on the deposit or withdrawal amount.\n4. If at any point the balance falls below 0 (i.e., `$balance < 0`), we immediately return `true`, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero.\n5. If we reach the end of the loop without returning true, it means no operation caused the balance to fall below zero, so we return false.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n```php\nprint(belowZero([1, 2, 3]) ? \"True\" : \"False\"); // False\nprint(\"\n\");\nprint(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5]) ? \"True\" : \"False\"); // True\n```\nI hope this meets your requirements!

We initialize a variable `$balance` to 0, which will keep track of our account balance.\n\n2. We loop through each operation in the list using `foreach`.\n\n3. Inside the loop, we add the current operation amount to the balance.\n\n4. After updating the balance, we check if it's less than zero. If it is, we immediately return `true`, because this means that at some point our account balance fell below zero.\n\n5. If we've checked all operations and haven't returned `true` yet, then the balance never fell below zero, so we return `false`.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the list, because it makes one pass through the entire list to check each operation."}
