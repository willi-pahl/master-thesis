{"result_0":"Here is the PHP function that meets the requirements:\n```php\n/**\n * Returns a tuple consisting of the sum and product of all integers in the given list.\n *\n * @param array $numbers A list of integers.\n *\n * @return array A tuple containing the sum and product of all integers in the list.\n */\nfunction sumProduct($numbers) {\n    $sum = 0;\n    $product = 1;\n\n    foreach ($numbers as $number) {\n        $sum += $number;\n        $product *= $number;\n    }\n\n    return [$sum, $product];\n}\n```\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n* We initialize two variables: `$sum` to store the sum of all numbers and `$product` to store their product. Both are initialized with default values (0 for sum and 1 for product).\n* We use a `foreach` loop to iterate over each number in the input list.\n* Inside the loop, we add each number to the running total (`$sum`) and multiply the current product by the number (`$product`).\n* After iterating over all numbers, we return an array containing both `$sum` and `$product`.\n\nExample usage:\n```php\nprint_r(sumProduct([])); // (0, 1)\nprint_r(sumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])); // (10, 24)\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes the input is a list of integers.

We initialize two variables: `$sum` to 0 and `$product` to 1.\n2. We iterate over each number in the input list using a `foreach` loop.\n3. Inside the loop, we add the current number to the sum and multiply it into the product.\n4. After iterating over all numbers, we return an array containing the final sum and product.\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n```php\nprint_r(sumProduct([])); // (0, 1)\nprint_r(sumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])); // (10, 24)\n```\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"}
