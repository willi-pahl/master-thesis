We start with a Fibonacci sequence array `$fib` containing the first two numbers (0 and 1).\n2. We loop until we have generated at least `n + 1` numbers in the sequence.\n3. Inside the loop, we calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers.\n4. If the next number is even or equal to 1, we skip it (since these are not prime).\n5. We check if the next number is prime by iterating from 3 to its square root and checking for divisibility. If it's divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.\n6. If the next number is prime, we add it to the `$fib` array.\n7. Finally, we return the last element of the `$fib` array (which is the `n-th` Fibonacci number that is also prime).\n\nYou can test this function with different values of `$n` to see the results:\n```php\necho primeFib(1); // 2\necho primeFib(2); // 3\necho primeFib(3); // 5\necho primeFib(4); // 13\necho primeFib(5); // 89\n```\nNote that this function uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is sufficient for small numbers but may not be efficient for larger inputs. If you need to handle larger values of `$n`, you may want to consider using a more advanced primality test or a probabilistic primality test."}

It does this by keeping track of the current Fibonacci number (`$fib`) and checking if it's prime using the `isPrime` function.\n\nThe `isPrime` function checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number, and checking if the number has any divisors in that range. If it does, then the number is not prime.\n\nYou can test this solution with the examples you provided:\n\n```php\necho primeFib(1); // Output: 2\necho primeFib(2); // Output: 3\necho primeFib(3); // Output: 5\necho primeFib(4); // Output: 13\necho primeFib(5); // Output: 89\n```"}
