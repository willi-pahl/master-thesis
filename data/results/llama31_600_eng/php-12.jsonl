We first check if the list has less than 3 elements. If it does, we immediately return `false` because it's impossible for three numbers to add up to zero.\n2. We sort the list in ascending order so that we can use a two-pointer technique to find pairs of elements that sum to zero with each element.\n3. We iterate over each element in the list and use two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end of the list, to find pairs of elements that could sum to zero with the current element.\n4. For each pair of elements, we calculate their sum and check if it's equal to zero. If it is, we return `true` because we've found three numbers that add up to zero.\n5. If the sum is less than zero, we move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, we move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.\n6.

First, we sort the input list in ascending order using the `sort()` function.\n2. We then iterate over each element in the sorted list using a for loop.\n3. For each element, we initialize two pointers: one at the next element (`$j`) and one at the end of the list (`$k`).\n4. We use the two-pointer technique to iterate over the remaining elements in the list. If the sum of the current three elements is zero, we return True.\n5. If the sum is less than zero, we increment `$j`. Otherwise, we decrement `$k`.\n6. If no three elements sum to zero after iterating over all possible combinations, we return False.\n\nYou can test this function using the examples you provided:\n```php\necho triplesSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0]) ?

First, we sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. We then iterate through the sorted list using three pointers: `i`, `left`, and `right`. The `i` pointer is used to keep track of the current element being considered for a triplet. The `left` pointer starts at `i + 1` and moves towards the right, while the `right` pointer starts at the end of the list and moves towards the left.\n3. For each element at index `i`, we skip duplicates by checking if the current element is equal to the previous one. If it is, we move on to the next element.\n4. We then enter a nested loop where we calculate the sum of the current triplet (`l[$i] + $l[$left] + $l[$right]`). If the sum is zero, we return `true` immediately.\n5. If the sum is less than zero, we move the `left` pointer to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, we move the `right` pointer to decrease the sum.\n6. We repeat this process until we've iterated through the entire list or found a triplet that sums to zero.\n\nExample use cases:\n```php\necho triplesSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1]) ? 'true' : 'false'; // true\necho triplesSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7]) ? 'true' : 'false'; // false\necho triplesSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]) ? 'true' : 'false'; // true\n```"}
