We start by initializing a divisor to 2, which is the smallest prime number.\n2. We then enter a loop where we continuously divide `n` by the current divisor until it doesn't divide evenly anymore.\n3. Inside the loop, we check if the current divisor is greater than the square root of `n`. If so, we can stop checking this range because any larger factor would have already been found as a smaller factor (due to the properties of prime numbers).\n4. Once we exit the loop, the last value of `$divisor` that was used will be either a prime factor of `n` or the smallest number that doesn't divide evenly into `n`. We can return this value as the largest prime factor.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n```php\necho largestPrimeFactor(13195); // Output: 29\necho largestPrimeFactor(2048); // Output: 2\n```\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is relatively efficient for large inputs."}
{"result_1":"Here's the implementation in PHP:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Returns the largest prime factor of n. \n * Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.\n *\n * @param int $n The input number.\n *\n * @return int The largest prime factor of n.\n */\nfunction largestPrimeFactor($n) {\n    // Initialize the divisor to 2, which is the smallest prime number\n    $i = 2;\n    \n    // Continue dividing until we reach the square root of n\n    while ($i * $i <= $n) {\n        // If n is divisible by i, then i is a factor\n        if ($n % $i != 0) {\n            // If not, increment i to try the next number\n            $i += 1;\n        } else {\n            // If it is, divide n by i and update the largest factor\n            $n = (int)($n / $i);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // At this point, n is a prime number and is the largest prime factor\n    return $n;\n}\n```\n\nThis function works by continuously dividing `n` by the smallest divisor that can divide it evenly. If `n` is not divisible by the current divisor (`$i`), we increment `$i`. If it is, we divide `n` by `$i` and repeat the process until we reach the square root of `n`, at which point `n` itself will be a prime number and the largest prime factor.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n\n```php\necho largestPrimeFactor(13195); // Output: 29\necho largestPrimeFactor(2048); // Output: 2\n```\n\nThis implementation has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large inputs."}

We initialize the `largest` variable to 2, which is the smallest prime number.\n2. We iterate from 3 to the square root of `n` with a step of 2 (since we're only interested in odd factors).\n3. Inside the loop, we check if `i` is a factor of `n`. If it is, we update the `largest` variable and divide `n` by `i`.\n4. After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 2, it means `n` itself is a prime number (the largest prime factor), so we return `n`. Otherwise, we return the `largest` prime factor found.\n\nExample usage:\n```php\necho largestPrimeFactor(13195); // Output: 29\necho largestPrimeFactor(2048); // Output: 2\n```\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large inputs."}
