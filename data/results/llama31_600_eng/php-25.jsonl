We initialize an empty array `$derivativeCoeffs` to store the coefficients of the derivative.\n2. We iterate over the coefficients of the original polynomial, starting from the first non-constant term (i.e., excluding the constant term).\n3. For each coefficient, we multiply it by its exponent (which is its position in the array) and append the result to `$derivativeCoeffs`.\n4. Finally, we return the array of coefficients representing the derivative.\n\nExample usage:\n```php\nprint_r(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]\nprint_r(derivative([1, 2, 3])); // Output: [2, 6]\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input array represents a polynomial with non-negative integer exponents. If you need to handle polynomials with fractional or negative exponents, you'll need to modify the code accordingly."}
