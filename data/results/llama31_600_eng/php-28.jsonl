We first create an associative array `$freq` where keys are integers from the input list and values are their frequencies using `array_count_values()`.\n2. We initialize the maximum value to be returned as `-1`, which will be updated if we find a number that meets the conditions.\n3. We iterate over the sorted list in descending order of integer values using `rsort()`. This is because we want to find the greatest such integer first.\n4. For each number, we check if its frequency is greater than or equal to its value and if it's greater than the current maximum value (`$maxVal`). If both conditions are true, we update `$maxVal`.\n5. Finally, we return the maximum value found.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n```php\necho search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]); // Output: 2\necho search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]); // Output: 3\necho search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]); // Output: -1\n```"}
