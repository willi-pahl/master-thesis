We first check if the three sides form a valid triangle by verifying that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.\n2. If they do not form a valid triangle, we immediately return -1.\n3. Otherwise, we calculate the semi-perimeter `s` of the triangle using the formula `(a + b + c) / 2`.\n4. We then use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle: `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`.\n5. Finally, we round the calculated area to 2 decimal points using the `round()` function and return it.\n\nYou can test this function with examples like:\n```php\necho triangleArea(3, 4, 5); // Output: 6.00\necho triangleArea(1, 2, 10); // Output: -1\n```\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input sides are non-negative and not equal to zero (since a side of length zero would not form a valid triangle). If you need to handle these edge cases explicitly, you can add additional checks at the beginning of the function."}
