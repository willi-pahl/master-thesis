{"result_0":"Here's a PHP function that counts the number of boredoms in a given string:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Counts the number of boredoms in a given string.\n * A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word \"I\".\n * Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.\n *\n * @param string $s The input string.\n *\n * @return int The number of boredoms.\n */\nfunction isBored($s){\n    // Split the string into sentences\n    $sentences = preg_split('/[.!?]/', $s);\n\n    // Initialize a counter for boredoms\n    $boredomCount = 0;\n\n    // Iterate over each sentence\n    foreach ($sentences as $sentence) {\n        // Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence\n        $sentence = trim($sentence);\n\n        // Check if the sentence starts with \"I\"\n        if (strpos($sentence, 'I') === 0) {\n            // If it does, increment the boredom count\n            $boredomCount++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Return the total number of boredoms\n    return $boredomCount;\n}\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how this function works:\n\n1. We use `preg_split` to split the input string into sentences based on the characters '.', '?', and '!'. This will give us an array of sentences.\n2. We initialize a counter variable `$boredomCount` to keep track of the number of boredoms we find.\n3. We iterate over each sentence in the array using `foreach`.\n4. For each sentence, we remove any leading or trailing whitespace using `trim`.\n5. We check if the sentence starts with \"I\" by calling `strpos`. If it does, we increment the `$boredomCount` variable.\n6. Finally, we return the total number of boredoms found.\n\nYou can test this function with some example inputs to see how it works:\n\n```php\necho isBored(\"Hello world\") . \"\n\"; // Output: 0\necho isBored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\") . \"\n\"; // Output: 1\n```\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."}

We use regular expressions to split the input string into an array of sentences, using `.`, `?`, and `!` as delimiters.\n2. We initialize a counter for boredoms to keep track of the number of sentences that start with \"I\".\n3. We iterate over each sentence in the array, removing leading and trailing whitespace from each sentence.\n4. For each sentence, we check if it starts with \"I\" (case-insensitive) using `stripos()`.\n5. If a sentence starts with \"I\", we increment the boredom count.\n6. Finally, we return the total number of boredoms found.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```php\necho isBored(\"Hello world\"); // Output: 0\necho isBored(\"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather\"); // Output: 1\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that sentences are separated by `.`, `?`, or `!` characters, and that the input string does not contain any other punctuation marks. If your use case requires more complex sentence parsing, you may need to modify the regular expression used for splitting the input string."}
