{"result_0":"Here is the PHP function to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm:\n```php\n/**\n * Returns the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.\n *\n * @param int $a The first integer.\n * @param int $b The second integer.\n *\n * @return int The greatest common divisor of a and b.\n */\nfunction greatestCommonDivisor($a, $b) {\n    while ($b != 0) {\n        // Swap the values of a and b\n        list($a, $b) = array($b, $a % $b);\n    }\n    \n    return abs($a); // Return the absolute value of the GCD\n}\n```\nHere's an explanation of how it works:\n\n1. The function takes two integers `$a` and `$b` as input.\n2. We use a `while` loop to repeatedly apply the Euclidean algorithm until we find the greatest common divisor.\n3. In each iteration, we swap the values of `$a` and `$b`, where `$b` is replaced by the remainder of `$a` divided by `$b`. This effectively reduces the problem size.\n4. Once `$b` becomes zero, we return the absolute value of `$a`, which is now the greatest common divisor.\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n```php\necho greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5); // Output: 1\necho greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15); // Output: 5\n```\nNote that we use `abs()` to return the absolute value of the GCD, since the Euclidean algorithm can produce a negative result if both input values are negative."}

The function takes two integers as input: `$a` and `$b`.\n2. We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. This involves repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0.\n3. At this point, `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.\n4. We return the absolute value of `a` (in case it's negative).\n\nExample use cases:\n```php\necho greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5); // Output: 1\necho greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15); // Output: 5\n```\nNote that this implementation has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), making it efficient for large inputs."}

At that point, `a` will be the GCD.\n\nIn this implementation, we use a simple while loop to perform the Euclidean algorithm. We keep track of the original value of `b` in a temporary variable `$temp`, so that we can restore it when we're done with the loop.\n\nFinally, we return the absolute value of the result, since the GCD is always non-negative.\n\nYou can test this function using the examples you provided:\n```php\necho greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5); // Output: 1\necho greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15); // Output: 5\n```\nI hope this helps!
