In each iteration, it adds the current level's stone count to the result array and updates the stone count for the next level based on whether the current level is even or odd. Finally, it reverses the result array (since we built it in reverse order) and returns it.\n\nNote that this implementation uses a simple iterative approach to build the result list, which should be efficient for small inputs.
