{"result_1":"Here is a well-documented and efficient PHP function that meets the requirements:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Returns the biggest even integer number in the range [x, y] inclusive.\n * If no such number exists, returns -1.\n *\n * @param int $x The start of the range (inclusive).\n * @param int $y The end of the range (inclusive).\n * @return int The biggest even integer in the range or -1 if not found.\n */\nfunction chooseNum($x, $y) {\n    // Ensure x is less than or equal to y\n    if ($x > $y) {\n        return -1; // No even number exists in this range\n    }\n\n    // Find the biggest even number in the range [x, y]\n    for ($i = max($x, 2); $i <= min($y, 10000); $i += 2) { // Assuming no even number is greater than 10,000\n        if ($i >= $x && $i <= $y) {\n            return $i; // Found the biggest even number in the range\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If no even number was found, return -1\n    return -1;\n}\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how this function works:\n\n*   We first check if `$x` is greater than `$y`. If it is, we immediately return `-1`, as there are no even numbers in the range `[x, y]`.\n*   Next, we use a `for` loop to iterate over all even numbers from 2 (the smallest possible even number) up to the maximum of `$y` and 10,000 (an arbitrary large number that is unlikely to be exceeded).\n*   Inside the loop, we check if the current even number `$i` falls within the range `[x, y]`. If it does, we return `$i`, as it's the biggest even number in the range.\n*   If no even number was found after iterating over all possible values, we return `-1`.\n\nYou can test this function with examples like `chooseNum(12, 15)` and `chooseNum(13, 12)`."}

First, we ensure that `$x` is not greater than `$y`. This is because the problem statement asks for the biggest even integer in the range `[x, y]`, and if `$x` were greater than `$y`, it would be impossible to find such a number.\n2. We then loop through numbers from `$y` down to `$x` (inclusive). For each number, we check whether it is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, then the number is even.\n3. As soon as we find an even number, we return it immediately. This is because the problem statement asks for the biggest even integer in the range, so there's no need to continue searching once we've found one.\n4. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any even numbers, then we return -1.\n\nYou can test this function with some examples:\n\n```php\necho chooseNum(12, 15); // Output: 14\necho chooseNum(13, 12); // Output: -1\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
