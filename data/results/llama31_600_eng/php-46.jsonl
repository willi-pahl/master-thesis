It first checks if `$n` is greater than `$m`, in which case it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of integers from `$n` to `$m` using the `array_sum` function with a range of numbers generated by `range($n, $m)`. The count of integers is calculated as `$m - $n + 1`. The average is then computed by dividing the sum by the count and rounding to the nearest integer using `round`. Finally, the rounded average is converted to binary using `decbin` and returned as a string prefixed with \"0b\"."}

We first check if `$n` is greater than `$m`, in which case we immediately return `-1`.\n2. We calculate the sum of integers from `$n` to `$m` (inclusive) using `array_sum(range($n, $m))`. This uses PHP's built-in `range()` function to generate an array of numbers from `$n` to `$m`, and then passes that array to `array_sum()` to calculate the sum.\n3. We calculate the count of integers in the range by subtracting `$n` from `$m` and adding 1 (since both ends are inclusive).\n4. We calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count, and round it to the nearest integer using `round()`.\n5. Finally, we convert the rounded average to binary using `decbin()` and return the result as a string.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n```php\necho roundedAvg(1, 5) . \"\n\"; // Output: \"0b11\"\necho roundedAvg(7, 5) . \"\n\"; // Output: \"-1\"\necho roundedAvg(10, 20) . \"\n\"; // Output: \"0b1111\"\necho roundedAvg(20, 33) . \"\n\"; // Output: \"0b11010\"\n```"}
