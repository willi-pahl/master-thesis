If it finds an odd number, it checks if there's a corresponding even number in `lst2` (by subtracting 1 from the odd number). If no matching even number is found, it immediately returns \"NO\". If all numbers are processed without finding any odd numbers or unmatched even numbers, it returns \"YES\"."}

If we find one, it means that we can make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging them with the corresponding odd numbers from `lst2`.\n*   If no odd number is found in `lst2`, we then check if all numbers in `lst1` are even. If any number in `lst1` is odd, it means that we cannot make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging them with the corresponding numbers from `lst2`. In this case, we return \"NO\".\n*   If all numbers in `lst1` are even and there's at least one odd number in `lst2`, we can make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging them with the corresponding odd numbers from `lst2`.
