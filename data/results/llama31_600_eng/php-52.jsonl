We first get the number of rows and columns in the grid.\n2. We initialize two variables: `$totalWater` to keep track of the total water in all wells, and `$bucketLowered` to keep track of the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered.\n3. We iterate over each row in the grid using a `foreach` loop.\n4. For each row, we calculate the total water in that row by summing up the values in the row (which represent units of water).\n5. We add the water in this row to the total water.\n6. After iterating over all rows, we calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered by dividing the total water by the capacity of the bucket and rounding up to the nearest integer using `ceil`.\n7. Finally, we return the result.\n\nYou can test this function with the example inputs you provided:\n```php\n$grid1 = [[0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]];\n$capacity1 = 1;\necho maxFill($grid1, $capacity1); // Output: 6\n\n$grid2 = [[0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1]];\n$capacity2 = 2;\necho maxFill($grid2, $capacity2); // Output: 5\n\n$grid3 = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]];\n$capacity3 = 5;\necho maxFill($grid3, $capacity3); // Output: 0\n```"}
