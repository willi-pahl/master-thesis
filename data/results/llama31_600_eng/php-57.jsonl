{"result_0":"Here is the PHP code that implements the Tribonacci sequence as per your requirements:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n *\n * @param int $n A non-negative integer number.\n *\n * @return array A list of integers representing the Tribonacci sequence.\n */\nfunction tri($n) {\n    // Initialize an array to store the Tribonacci sequence\n    $trib = [3]; // tri(1) = 3\n\n    // Generate the first n numbers of the Tribonacci sequence\n    for ($i = 2; $i <= $n + 1; $i++) {\n        if ($i % 2 == 0) { // If i is even, calculate tri(i) as 1 + i / 2\n            $trib[] = 1 + (int)($i / 2);\n        } else { // If i is odd, calculate tri(i) as the sum of the three preceding numbers\n            $trib[] = array_sum(array_slice($trib, -$3));\n        }\n    }\n\n    return $trib;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nprint_r(tri(3)); // Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `tri` that takes an integer `$n` as input and returns an array of integers representing the first `$n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The function uses a loop to generate the sequence, using the recurrence relations for even and odd indices.\n\nNote that I used the `(int)` cast when calculating `tri(i)` for even indices to ensure that the result is an integer. This is because the expression `i / 2` may produce a floating-point number if `i` is large enough, but we want the result to be an integer in this case.\n\nAlso note that I used the `array_slice` function with a negative offset (`-$3`) to get the last three elements of the `$trib` array when calculating `tri(i)` for odd indices. This allows us to access the preceding numbers without having to keep track of their indices separately."}
{"result_1":"Here is the PHP function that implements the Tribonacci sequence:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Returns a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n *\n * @param int $n A non-negative integer number.\n *\n * @return array The first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n */\nfunction tri($n) {\n    // Initialize an array to store the Tribonacci sequence\n    $trib = [3, 2];\n\n    // Generate the rest of the sequence up to the nth term\n    for ($i = 2; $i <= $n; $i++) {\n        if ($i % 2 == 0) { // If i is even\n            $nextTerm = 1 + (int)($i / 2);\n        } else { // If i is odd\n            $nextTerm = array_sum(array_slice($trib, -$3));\n        }\n        $trib[] = $nextTerm;\n    }\n\n    return array_merge([$trib[0]], $trib); // Return the first n + 1 terms of the sequence\n}\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how this function works:\n\n*   We start by initializing an array `$trib` with the first two terms of the Tribonacci sequence, which are `3` and `2`.\n*   Then we use a loop to generate the rest of the sequence up to the nth term. Inside the loop, we check whether the current index `$i` is even or odd.\n    *   If `$i` is even, we calculate the next term as `1 + (int)($i / 2)`.\n    *   If `$i` is odd, we calculate the next term by summing up the last three terms of the sequence (`$trib[-3]`, `$trib[-2]`, and `$trib[-1]`).\n*   After generating all the terms up to the nth index, we return an array containing the first n + 1 terms of the Tribonacci sequence. We use `array_merge` to prepend the first term (which is always `3`) to the rest of the sequence.\n\nYou can test this function with different values for `$n`, like so:\n\n```php\nprint_r(tri(3)); // Output: [3, 2, 8]\nprint_r(tri(4)); // Output: [3, 2, 8, 11]\n```\n\nNote that the Tribonacci sequence is not as well-known or widely studied as the Fibonacci sequence. However, it has its own interesting properties and patterns!"}
