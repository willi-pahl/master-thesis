If we find any pair of adjacent elements where the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one, we immediately return -1.\n* If no such pair is found after iterating through the entire array, it means that all pairs of adjacent elements have the property that the current element is less than the previous one. In this case, we iterate through the array from right to left and find the largest index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. We return this index.\n* If no such index is found after iterating through the entire array from right to left, it means that all elements in the array are in non-decreasing order. In this case, we return -1.\n\nYou can test this function with the examples you provided:\n\n```php\nprint(canArrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]) . \"\n\"); // Output: 3\nprint(canArrange([1, 2, 3]) . \"\n\"); // Output: -1\n```\n\nI hope this helps!
