{"result_0":"Here is the PHP code that solves the problem:\n\n```php\n/**\n * Returns a string containing words from the original sentence,\n * whose lengths are prime numbers, in the same order.\n *\n * @param string $sentence The input sentence.\n *\n * @return string A new sentence with only words of prime length.\n */\nfunction wordsInSentence($sentence) {\n    // Split the sentence into an array of words\n    $words = explode(' ', $sentence);\n\n    // Function to check if a number is prime\n    function isPrime($n) {\n        if ($n <= 1) return false;\n        for ($i = 2; $i * $i <= $n; $i++) {\n            if ($n % $i == 0) return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    // Filter the words array to only include words of prime length\n    $primeWords = array_filter($words, function($word) use (&$isPrime) {\n        return isPrime(strlen($word));\n    });\n\n    // Join the filtered words back into a sentence\n    return implode(' ', $primeWords);\n}\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of how this code works:\n\n1. We first split the input sentence into an array of words using `explode`.\n2. We define a helper function `isPrime` that checks if a given number is prime.\n3. We use `array_filter` to filter the words array and only include words whose lengths are prime numbers.\n4. Finally, we join the filtered words back into a sentence using `implode`.\n\nYou can test this code with the example inputs you provided:\n\n```php\necho wordsInSentence(\"This is a test\") . \"\n\"; // Output: \"is\"\necho wordsInSentence(\"lets go for swimming\") . \"\n\"; // Output: \"go for\"\n```\n\nNote that I used an anonymous function as the callback to `array_filter` to make the code more concise. If you prefer not to use anonymous functions, you can define a separate named function instead."}
