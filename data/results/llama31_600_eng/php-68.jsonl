The callback function checks each number using the `isOddFirstLastDigit` helper function.\n\nThe `isOddFirstLastDigit` function checks if a number has both first and last digits odd by:\n\n1. Checking if the number is greater than 10.\n2. Using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the last digit is odd (remainder of division by 2 should be non-zero).\n3. Converting the first character of the string representation of the number to an integer using `(int) substr($number, 0, 1)` and checking if it's odd.\n\nExample usage:\n```php\n$numbers = [15, -73, 14, -15];\necho specialFilter($numbers); // Output: 1\n\n$numbers = [33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109];\necho specialFilter($numbers); // Output: 2\n```\nNote that I've used type declarations and docblocks to make the code more readable and maintainable."}

Both first and last digits are odd (using the modulo operator `%`).\n\nIf both conditions are met, it increments the count.\n\nThe `isOdd` function takes a single integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number meets the condition. It uses PHP's string manipulation functions to extract the first and last digits of the number, converts them to integers using `(int)`, and checks if they are odd using the modulo operator `%`.\n\nYou can test this code with the example inputs you provided:\n```php\n$nums1 = [15, -73, 14, -15];\necho specialFilter($nums1); // Output: 1\n\n$nums2 = [33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109];\necho specialFilter($nums2); // Output: 2\n```\nNote that I used type declarations for the function parameters and return types to make the code more explicit and self-documenting."}
