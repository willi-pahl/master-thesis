If it's even, we calculate the next number as `1 + n / 2`. If it's odd, we calculate the next number using the recurrence relation.\n- We append each new number to our sequence list and continue until we've generated all numbers up to `$n`.\n- Finally, we return a slice of our sequence list containing only the first `$n+1` elements.\n\nYou can test this function with different inputs like so:\n\n```php\nprint_r(tri(3)); // Output: [1, 3, 2, 8]\nprint_r(tri(5)); // Output: [1, 3, 2, 8, 21]\n```"}
