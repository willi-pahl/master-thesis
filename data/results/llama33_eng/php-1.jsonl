The sum is initialized to 0 (empty sum) and the product is initialized to 1 (empty product). It then iterates over each number in the list, adding it to the sum and multiplying it with the product. Finally, it returns a tuple consisting of the sum and the product.\n\nExample use cases:\n\n* `sumProduct(array())` returns `(0, 1)`, which is the expected result for an empty list.\n* `sumProduct(array(1, 2, 3, 4))` returns `(10, 24)`, which is the expected result for a non-empty list."}

It initializes `$sum` to 0 and `$product` to 1, then iterates over each number in the input array, adding it to `$sum` and multiplying it with `$product`. Finally, it returns the calculated sum and product as an array.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We initialize `$sum` to 0 because the sum of no numbers is 0.\n*   We initialize `$product` to 1 because the product of no numbers is 1 (the multiplicative identity).\n*   The `foreach` loop iterates over each number in the input array, updating `$sum` and `$product` accordingly.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n*   `sumProduct([])` returns `(0, 1)`, demonstrating that the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of an empty list is 1.\n*   `sumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `(10, 24)`, showing the correct calculation for a non-empty list."}
