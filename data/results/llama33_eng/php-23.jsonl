We start by dividing `$n` by 2 until it's no longer divisible. This is because 2 is the smallest prime number.\n2. Then we iterate from 3 to the square root of `$n`, incrementing by 2 each time (since all primes are of the form `6k ± 1`). For each number, we divide `$n` by it until it's no longer divisible.\n3.

If it's a factor, we add it to our array and divide `$n` by that factor. We repeat this process until `$n` is no longer divisible by any number in our range. At the end, if `$n` is still greater than 1, it means `$n` itself is a prime number, so we add it to our array.

It then divides `$n` by this factor as many times as possible, adding each instance to an array of prime factors. The process continues until all factors have been found and divided out, at which point the largest remaining factor is returned.\n\nHowever, please note that for larger inputs or less efficient division methods, a more optimized approach might be necessary to avoid performance issues. \n\nHere's an alternative solution with improved efficiency:\n```php\nfunction largestPrimeFactor($n) {\n    $i = 2;\n    while ($i * $i <= $n) {\n        if ($n % $i == 0) {\n            $n /= $i;\n        } else {\n            $i++;\n        }\n    }\n    return $n;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\necho largestPrimeFactor(13195);  // Output: 29\necho largestPrimeFactor(2048);   // Output: 2\n```\nThis version uses a more efficient algorithm that only checks up to the square root of `$n`, reducing unnecessary iterations. It also directly returns the remaining value of `$n` after dividing out all smaller factors, which is guaranteed to be the largest prime factor due to the nature of the algorithm."}
