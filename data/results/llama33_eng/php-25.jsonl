It iterates over the input array, starting from the second element (index 1), and for each coefficient, it calculates the corresponding coefficient in the derivative by multiplying the current coefficient with its index. The calculated coefficients are then added to a result array, which is returned as the derivative of the input polynomial."}

It takes an array of coefficients as input and returns the derivative in the same form. The derivative is calculated by multiplying each coefficient with its power (starting from 1) and storing the results in a new array.\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*   We start by initializing an empty array `$result` to store the result.\n*   Then, we loop through each coefficient in the input array, starting from the second one (index 1).\n*   For each coefficient, we calculate the new coefficient by multiplying it with its power (`$i`).\n*   The new coefficient is then added to the `$result` array.\n*   Finally, we return the `$result` array.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n\n*   `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])`: This should return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which represents the derivative of the polynomial `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4`.\n*   `derivative([1, 2, 3])`: This should return `[2, 6]`, representing the derivative of the polynomial `1 + 2x + 3x^2`."}
