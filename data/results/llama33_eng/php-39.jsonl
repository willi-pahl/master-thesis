It then iterates over each sentence, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with \"I\" (case-insensitive) using the `stripos` function. If a sentence starts with \"I\", it increments a counter for boredoms. Finally, it returns the total count of boredoms found in the input string."}

It then iterates over each sentence, trims any unnecessary whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with \"I\" using a case-insensitive comparison. If it does, it increments a counter for boredom sentences. Finally, it returns the total count of such sentences."}
