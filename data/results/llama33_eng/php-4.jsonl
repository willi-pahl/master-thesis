Repeat steps 1-2 until `b` is zero.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)` returns `1`, because the only common divisor of 3 and 5 is 1.\n* `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)` returns `5`, because the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15 is 5."}

The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is zero. At this point, `a` is the greatest common divisor.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. We start with two numbers, `$a` and `$b`.\n2. If `$b` is not zero, we calculate the remainder of `$a` divided by `$b` using the modulo operator (`%`).\n3. We then swap the values of `$a` and `$b`, so that `$a` becomes the old value of `$b`, and `$b` becomes the remainder.\n4. We repeat steps 2-3 until `$b` is zero.\n5. At this point, `$a` is the greatest common divisor.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose we want to find the greatest common divisor of `25` and `15`. The algorithm would work as follows:\n\n* Initially, `$a = 25` and `$b = 15`.\n* First iteration: `$temp = 15`, `$b = 25 % 15 = 10`, `$a = 15`.\n* Second iteration: `$temp = 10`, `$b = 15 % 10 = 5`, `$a = 10`.\n* Third iteration: `$temp = 5`, `$b = 10 % 5 = 0`, `$a = 5`.\n* Since `$b` is now zero, we return `$a`, which is `5`."}

The basic idea is that the GCD of `a` and `b` is equal to the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This process continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` is the GCD.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. If `$b` is zero, then the GCD is `$a`.\n2. Otherwise, recursively call the function with `$b` and the remainder of `$a` divided by `$b`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)) because in each recursive call, we reduce the size of one of the numbers (`$a` or `$b`) by at least half. The space complexity is O(log min(a, b)) due to the recursion stack."}
