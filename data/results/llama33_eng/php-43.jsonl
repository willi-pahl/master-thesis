The first level always has `n` stones, and subsequent levels have either the next odd or even number depending on the parity of `n`. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `$result` to store the stone counts for each level.\n2. Loop through each level (from 0 to `n-1`).\n3. For the first level (`$i == 0`), add `n` stones to the result array.\n4. For subsequent levels, calculate the next number based on whether `n` is odd or even:\n   - If `n` is odd, the next number is the current number plus 2 (to get the next odd number).\n   - If `n` is even, the next number is the current number plus 2 (to get the next even number).\n5. Add the calculated stone count for each level to the result array.\n6. Return the result array.\n\nYou can test this function with different inputs, such as `makeAPile(3)`, which should output `[3, 5, 7]`."}

The function uses a loop to generate the sequence of stone counts, based on whether the current count is even or odd.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. Initialize an empty array `$result` to store the sequence of stone counts.\n2. Loop `$n` times to generate the sequence:\n   * If it's the first iteration (`$i == 0`), add the initial value of `$n` to the result array.\n   * Otherwise, check if the current count is even or odd using the modulo operator (`$n % 2 == 0`):\n     + If even, increment `$n` by 2 and add it to the result array.\n     + If odd, increment `$n` by 2 and add it to the result array (same logic as for even).\n3. Return the completed result array.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n* `makeAPile(3)` returns `[3, 5, 7]`\n* `makeAPile(4)` returns `[4, 6, 8, 10]`\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the input `$n` is a positive integer. If you need to handle other types of input or edge cases, additional checks and error handling may be necessary."}
