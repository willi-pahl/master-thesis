Then, it explodes the string into an array using space as the delimiter. The result is an array of words.\n\nNote: This function assumes that there are no leading or trailing spaces in the input string, and that there are no multiple consecutive spaces between words. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need to modify the function accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a regular expression to split the string:\n\n```php\nfunction wordsString($s) {\n    return preg_split('/[\s,]+/', $s, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);\n}\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses `preg_split` to split the string into an array using one or more whitespace characters or commas as the delimiter. The `PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY` flag is used to remove any empty strings from the result."}

Then, it splits the string into an array using space as the delimiter. The resulting array contains the individual words from the input string.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a regular expression to split the string:\n\n```php\nfunction wordsString($s) {\n    return preg_split('/[\s,]+/', $s, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);\n}\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses `preg_split` to split the string into an array. The regular expression `[\s,]+` matches one or more whitespace characters or commas. The `PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY` flag tells `preg_split` not to include empty strings in the output array."}

Then, it splits the string into an array using space as the delimiter. The resulting array contains the individual words from the input string.\n\n**Note:** This implementation assumes that there are no leading or trailing spaces in the input string and that there are no multiple consecutive spaces between words.

This will correctly handle cases where there are multiple consecutive spaces between words."}

It first replaces all commas with spaces to make it easier to split the string. Then, it uses the `explode` function to split the string into an array of words, using a space as the delimiter. Finally, it returns the array of words.\n\nWhen you run this code with the example inputs, it will output:\n\n```php\nArray\n(\n    [0] => Hi\n    [1] => my\n    [2] => name\n    [3] => is\n    [4] => John\n)\nArray\n(\n    [0] => One\n    [1] => two\n    [2] => three\n    [3] => four\n    [4] => five\n    [5] => six\n)\n```"}
