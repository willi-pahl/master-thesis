It uses an array to store the calculated values and handles both even and odd cases according to the given recurrence relation.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We initialize an empty array `$tribonacci` with the first value as 3, which is `tri(1)`.\n*   Then we loop through each number from 2 to n (inclusive).\n*   Inside the loop, we check if the current number `i` is even or odd.\n*   If `i` is even, we calculate `tri(i)` as `1 + i / 2` and append it to the `$tribonacci` array.\n*   If `i` is odd, we calculate `tri(i)` as `tri(i-1) + tri(i-2) + tri(i+1)`. However, since we don't have the value of `tri(i+1)`, we need to handle this case separately. We break the loop when `i` equals `n + 1`.\n*   After calculating all values up to `n`, we return the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence using `array_slice`.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n)\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n)"}

The sequence is calculated using a loop that iterates from 2 to n+1, applying the recurrence relation for even and odd indices. Note that this implementation uses an array to store the calculated values, which allows it to handle the recursive formula efficiently.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   We initialize an array `$tribonacci` with two elements: `[0, 3]`. The first element is not used (it's just a placeholder), and the second element corresponds to `tri(1) = 3`.\n*   We then calculate each term of the sequence using a loop that iterates from `2` to `n+1`.\n*   Inside the loop, we check whether the current index `$i` is even or odd. If it's even, we apply the formula `1 + $i / 2`. If it's odd, we use the recursive formula `tri($i - 1) + tri($i - 2) + tri($i + 1)`.\n*   After calculating all terms up to `n+1`, we return the calculated sequence as an array.\n*   The test case demonstrates how to call the function with a specific value of `n` (in this case, `3`) and prints the resulting Tribonacci sequence."}

The sequence is calculated based on the provided recurrence relations. Note that this implementation assumes that the input `$n` is a non-negative integer.\n\n**Important:** This solution might not work correctly for large inputs due to potential issues with floating-point arithmetic and the recursive nature of the Tribonacci sequence, which can lead to very large numbers quickly. For practical purposes, you may want to add error checking code or optimize this function further to handle such edge cases more robustly.\n\nAlso, please note that PHP has a maximum execution time limit (usually set by your server's configuration) and might not be able to calculate very large sequences due to this limitation."}
