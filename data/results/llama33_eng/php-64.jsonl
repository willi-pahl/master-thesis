It does this by iterating from `n` down to 1, calculating the factorial of each number in that range, and multiplying these factorials together. The result is then returned.\n\nNote: This solution has an exponential time complexity due to the nested loops. For large inputs, it may be more efficient to use a different algorithm or data structure, such as memoization or dynamic programming, to store and reuse previously computed values. However, for small inputs like `n = 4`, this solution should work fine. \n\nAlso note that this function does not include any error checking. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to ensure that the input is a positive integer."}

The outer loop iterates from the input number down to 1, and for each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number using the inner loop. The result is then multiplied with the previously calculated factorials.\n\nPlease note that this function may cause an overflow error for large input values because the result can exceed the maximum limit of an integer in PHP. To avoid this issue, you might need to use a library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic or handle the calculation differently."}
